# AdMob Banner Ads Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Banner ad failed to load" Error

#### Possible Causes & Solutions:

#### 1️⃣ **New Ad Units Need Time to Activate**
**Problem**: AdMob ad units take 1-24 hours to become fully active after creation.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Wait 1-2 hours after creating ad units
- ✅ New ad units often show error code 3 (no fill) initially
- ✅ This is NORMAL and will resolve automatically

**Timeline**:
- First 1 hour: High failure rate (expected)
- After 2-4 hours: Ads start showing occasionally
- After 24 hours: Normal ad delivery

---

#### 2️⃣ **Internet Connection Issues**
**Problem**: Ads require active internet connection to load.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Ensure device has stable internet
- ✅ Try switching between WiFi and mobile data
- ✅ Check firewall/VPN isn't blocking Google ad servers

---

#### 3️⃣ **Incorrect Ad Unit IDs**
**Problem**: Wrong ad unit ID in code.

**Verification**:
```dart
// Check lib/core/services/admob_service.dart line 19-20
static const String _androidBannerAdUnitId = 'ca-app-pub-3453955058123201/7401175652';
static const String _androidInterstitialAdUnitId = 'ca-app-pub-3453955058123201/4775012316';
```

**Your IDs should match exactly:**
- Banner: `ca-app-pub-3453955058123201/7401175652`
- Interstitial: `ca-app-pub-3453955058123201/4775012316`
- App ID: `ca-app-pub-3453955058123201~2131525346`

---

#### 4️⃣ **App ID Mismatch in Manifest**
**Problem**: AndroidManifest.xml has wrong App ID.

**Verification**:
Check `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` line 46:
```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
    android:value="ca-app-pub-3453955058123201~2131525346"/>
```

Should be: `ca-app-pub-3453955058123201~2131525346` (with tilde ~, not slash /)

---

#### 5️⃣ **AdMob Account Under Review**
**Problem**: New AdMob accounts may be under review.

**Check**:
1. Go to https://admob.google.com
2. Check for any warnings/notifications
3. Verify account status is "Active"
4. Complete any required verifications

---

#### 6️⃣ **Low Ad Inventory in Your Region**
**Problem**: Not enough advertisers bidding for your region.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Normal for new apps with low traffic
- ✅ Will improve as you get more users
- ✅ Fill rate improves over time
- ✅ Consider targeting broader keywords

---

#### 7️⃣ **AdMob Policy Violations**
**Problem**: App content violates AdMob policies.

**Check**:
- ✅ No adult content
- ✅ No violence/illegal content
- ✅ Privacy policy implemented
- ✅ COPPA compliance (if targeting children)

---

## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Error Logging**
Banner ad now logs detailed error information:
```
❌ Banner ad failed to load: 3 - No fill
   Domain: com.google.android.gms.ads
```

### 2. **Automatic Retry Logic**
- Retries up to 3 times for recoverable errors
- 3-second delay between retries
- Only retries for error codes 0 and 3

### 3. **Graceful Fallback**
- Shows loading indicator while loading
- Hides ad space if fails after 3 retries
- Optional error widget for debugging

### 4. **Always Use Real Ads**
- No longer using test ads in debug mode
- Directly using your real ad unit IDs
- Better for testing actual ad delivery

---

## 🧪 How to Test & Debug

### Step 1: Check Logs
Run your app and watch the console for:
```
🔄 Loading banner ad (Attempt 1/3)
📱 Using Ad Unit ID: ca-app-pub-3453955058123201/7401175652
✅ Banner ad loaded successfully
```

OR error messages:
```
❌ Banner ad failed to load: 3 - No fill
   Domain: com.google.android.gms.ads
🔄 Retrying banner ad in 3 seconds...
```

### Step 2: Understand Error Codes

| Error Code | Meaning | Solution |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **0** | Internal error | Retry automatically |
| **1** | Invalid request | Check ad unit ID |
| **2** | Network error | Check internet |
| **3** | No fill | Normal for new accounts, wait |
| **8** | Invalid App ID | Check AndroidManifest.xml |

### Step 3: Run Debug Build
```bash
flutter run --debug
```

Watch console output for ad loading attempts and errors.

### Step 4: Test on Real Device
AdMob works better on real devices than emulators.

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### First Hour After Setup
```
❌ Banner ad failed to load: 3 - No fill (80-100% failure rate)
```
**This is NORMAL!** New ad units need time.

### After 2-4 Hours
```
✅ Banner ad loaded successfully (20-50% success rate)
❌ Banner ad failed to load: 3 - No fill (50-80% failure)
```
**Still normal!** Inventory is building.

### After 24 Hours
```
✅ Banner ad loaded successfully (60-90% success rate)
❌ Banner ad failed to load: 3 - No fill (10-40% failure)
```
**Good!** Normal ad delivery with typical fill rate.
