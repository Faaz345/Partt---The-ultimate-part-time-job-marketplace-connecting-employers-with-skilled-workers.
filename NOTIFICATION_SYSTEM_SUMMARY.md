## üìã Quick Integration Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Notification Settings for New Users

**In your signup/profile setup screens:**

```dart
import 'package:partt/core/helpers/notification_integration_helper.dart';

// After creating user profile
await NotificationIntegrationHelper.initializeUserNotificationSettings(userId);
```

**Files to modify:**
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/manager_signup_screen.dart` (after line 120)
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/worker_signup_screen.dart` (after user creation)
- `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/manager_profile_setup_screen.dart` (after line 952)
- `lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/worker_profile_setup_screen.dart` (after profile save)

### Step 2: Send Notifications When Jobs Are Posted

**In your job posting screen (after job is created):**

```dart
import 'package:partt/core/helpers/notification_integration_helper.dart';

// After successfully creating a job
await NotificationIntegrationHelper.notifyWorkersAboutNewJob(
  jobId: createdJobId,
  jobTitle: jobTitle,
  businessName: businessName,
  location: location,
);
```

**File to modify:**
- `lib/features/jobs/presentation/screens/job_posting_screen.dart`

### Step 3: Send Notifications When Workers Apply

**In your job application screen (after application is submitted):**

```dart
import 'package:partt/core/helpers/notification_integration_helper.dart';

// After successfully creating application
await NotificationIntegrationHelper.notifyManagerAboutApplication(
  managerId: job.managerId,
  jobId: jobId,
  applicationId: applicationId,
  workerName: currentUserName,
  jobTitle: job.title,
);
```

**File to modify:**
- `lib/features/jobs/presentation/screens/job_application_screen.dart`

### Step 4: Send Notifications When Application Status Changes

**In your manager applications screen (when accepting/rejecting):**

```dart
import 'package:partt/core/helpers/notification_integration_helper.dart';

// When manager updates application status
await NotificationIntegrationHelper.notifyWorkerAboutApplicationStatus(
  workerId: application.workerId,
  applicationId: application.id,
  jobTitle: job.title,
  businessName: businessName,
  status: newStatus, // 'shortlisted', 'accepted', or 'rejected'
);
```

**File to modify:**
- `lib/features/jobs/presentation/screens/manager_applications_screen.dart`

### Step 5: Send Notifications for Chat Messages

**In your chat service (after sending a message):**

```dart
import 'package:partt/core/helpers/notification_integration_helper.dart';

// After sending a message
await NotificationIntegrationHelper.notifyUserAboutChatMessage(
  recipientId: recipientUserId,
  senderId: currentUserId,
  senderName: currentUserName,
  message: messageText,
  conversationId: conversationId,
);
```

**File to modify:**
- `lib/core/services/chat_service.dart` (or wherever you send messages)

## üß™ Testing

### Test In-App Notifications:

```dart
// Add to any screen for testing
import 'package:partt/core/services/notification_service.dart';
import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';

final _notificationService = NotificationService();

// Test button
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await _notificationService.sendSystemNotification(
      userId: FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser!.uid,
      title: 'Test Notification',
      message: 'If you see this, notifications are working!',
      priority: 'high',
    );
  },
  child: Text('Send Test Notification'),
)
```

### Test Push Notifications:

1. Complete FCM setup
2. Get FCM token: `final token = await FCMService.getToken();`
3. Send test from Firebase Console ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
4. Lock phone and wait for notification

## üí° Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with in-app notifications, then add FCM later
2. **Test on Real Device**: Push notifications don't work well on emulators
3. **Monitor Firestore**: Check notification documents are being created
4. **Check Logs**: Use `print` statements to debug notification sending
5. **User Experience**: Don't spam users with too many notifications
