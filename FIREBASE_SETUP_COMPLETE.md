# Firebase Setup Complete! âœ…

## What Was Done

### 1. âœ… Firestore Security Rules Added
The following security rules have been added and deployed to Firebase:

#### Notifications Collection Rules
```javascript
match /notifications/{notificationId} {
  // Users can only read their own notifications
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
              request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  
  // Any authenticated user can create notifications
  // This allows managers to send notifications to workers and vice versa
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Users can only update/delete their own notifications
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
                          request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}
```

#### Notification Settings Collection Rules
```javascript
match /notificationSettings/{userId} {
  // Users can only read/write their own notification settings
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                       request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

**Status:** âœ… Deployed successfully to `partt-2d8fb`

---

### 2. âœ… Firestore Indexes Created
Three composite indexes have been created for optimal query performance:

#### Index 1: Notifications by User and Creation Time
- Collection: `notifications`
- Fields:
  - `userId` (Ascending)
  - `createdAt` (Descending)
- **Purpose:** Fetch user's notifications sorted by newest first

#### Index 2: Unread Notifications by User
- Collection: `notifications`
- Fields:
  - `userId` (Ascending)
  - `isRead` (Ascending)
- **Purpose:** Count and query unread notifications

#### Index 3: Notifications by User, Type, and Time
- Collection: `notifications`
- Fields:
  - `userId` (Ascending)
  - `type` (Ascending)
  - `createdAt` (Descending)
- **Purpose:** Filter notifications by type (Jobs, Messages, System)

**Status:** âœ… Deployed successfully to `partt-2d8fb`

## Verification Steps

### Check Rules in Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/partt-2d8fb/firestore/rules
2. You should see the notification rules at the bottom of the rules file

### Check Indexes in Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/partt-2d8fb/firestore/indexes
2. You should see 3 new indexes for the `notifications` collection:
   - Building status will show "Enabled" once complete (usually takes a few minutes)

## Next Steps to Complete Integration

### 1. Add Notification Bell Icon to Dashboard Screens

Add this code to both `manager_dashboard_screen.dart` and `worker_dashboard_screen.dart`:

```dart
import '../../../../core/services/notification_service.dart';
import '../../../notifications/presentation/screens/notifications_screen.dart';

// In AppBar actions:
actions: [
  StreamBuilder<int>(
    stream: NotificationService().getUnreadNotificationsCount(),
    builder: (context, snapshot) {
      final unreadCount = snapshot.data ?? 0;
      
      return Stack(
        children: [
          IconButton(
            icon: const Icon(Icons.notifications),
            onPressed: () {
              Navigator.of(context).push(
                MaterialPageRoute(
                  builder: (context) => const NotificationsScreen(),
                ),
              );
            },
          ),
          if (unreadCount > 0)
            Positioned(
              right: 8,
              top: 8,
              child: Container(
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(4.w),
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  color: Colors.red,
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.r),
                ),
                constraints: BoxConstraints(
                  minWidth: 18.w,
                  minHeight: 18.h,
                ),
                child: Text(
                  unreadCount > 99 ? '99+' : unreadCount.toString(),
                  style: TextStyle(
                    color: Colors.white,
                    fontSize: 10.sp,
                    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                  ),
                  textAlign: TextAlign.center,
                ),
              ),
            ),
        ],
      );
    },
  ),
  // Your existing profile icon
],
```

### 2. Send Notifications in Your Code

Refer to `NOTIFICATION_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed examples of:
- Sending job posted notifications
- Sending application notifications
- Sending application status notifications
- Sending chat message notifications
- Initializing notification settings for new users

---

## Test the Notification System

### Quick Test in Flutter
Add this test code to any screen to verify notifications work:

```dart
import '../../../core/services/notification_service.dart';

final _notificationService = NotificationService();

// Test button
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await _notificationService.sendSystemNotification(
      userId: FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser!.uid,
      title: 'Test Notification',
      message: 'If you can see this in the notifications screen, it works!',
      priority: 'high',
    );
    
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Test notification sent!')),
    );
  },
  child: Text('Send Test Notification'),
),
```

### Expected Behavior
1. Click "Send Test Notification"
2. Open notifications screen (bell icon)
3. You should see the test notification
4. Notification should have a red dot (unread)
5. Tap notification to mark as read
6. Red dot should disappear

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that indexes are fully built (Firebase Console â†’ Indexes)
2. Verify Firebase Auth is working (user must be logged in)
3. Check Firestore console for any security rule violations
4. Review the integration guide for code examples
