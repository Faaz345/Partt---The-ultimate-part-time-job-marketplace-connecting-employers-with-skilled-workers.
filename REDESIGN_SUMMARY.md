## 🎨 Design Pattern

All screens follow this consistent pattern:

```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    gradient: LinearGradient(
      colors: [
        AppConstants.primaryColor,
        AppConstants.primaryColor.withOpacity(0.8),
        AppConstants.darkBackground,
      ],
    ),
  ),
  child: Card(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(24.r),
    // White card content with rounded inputs
  ),
)
```

### Input Field Pattern
```dart
TextFormField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    filled: true,
    fillColor: AppConstants.backgroundColor,
    border: OutlineInputBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16.r),
      borderSide: BorderSide.none,
    ),
    focusedBorder: OutlineInputBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16.r),
      borderSide: BorderSide(color: AppConstants.primaryColor, width: 2),
    ),
  ),
)
```

### Button Pattern
```dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    backgroundColor: AppConstants.primaryColor,
    padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 18.h),
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16.r),
    ),
    elevation: 0,
  ),
)
```

## 🔒 Role Validation Logic

### Registration
1. Check if email exists with different role
2. If yes → Show error: "This email is already registered as a [opposite_role]"
3. If no → Proceed with registration
4. Create user with specified role
5. Navigate to role-specific profile setup

### Login
1. Check if user exists with specified role
2. If no → Check if user exists with different role
3. If different role → Show error: "This email is registered as a [opposite_role]"
4. If user doesn't exist → Show error: "No account found"
5. If valid → Sign in and navigate to dashboard or profile setup

## 📊 Database Structure

```
users/
  {userId}/
    - email: string
    - role: 'worker' | 'manager'
    - fullName: string
    - phoneNumber: string
    - age: number
    - location: string
    - skills: string[]
    - businessDetails: {} (only for managers)
    - isProfileComplete: boolean
    - createdAt: timestamp
    - updatedAt: timestamp
```
