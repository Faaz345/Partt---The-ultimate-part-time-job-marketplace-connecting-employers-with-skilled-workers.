## 🔒 Google Sign-In Flow

### For Login Screens (Worker & Manager)
1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Google Sign-In picker appears
3. User selects Google account
4. System checks if user exists in Firestore
5. **If existing user:**
   - Validates role (worker/manager)
   - If wrong role → Signs out + shows error
   - If correct role → Checks profile completion
   - Navigates to dashboard or profile setup
6. **If new user:**
   - Creates Firestore document with appropriate role
   - Sets `isProfileComplete: false`
   - Navigates to profile setup

### For Signup Screens (Worker & Manager)
1. User agrees to Terms & Conditions (required)
2. User clicks "Sign up with Google"
3. Google Sign-In picker appears
4. User selects Google account
5. System checks if user exists in Firestore
6. **If exists with same role:**
   - Just navigates to profile setup (like login)
7. **If exists with different role:**
   - Signs out immediately
   - Shows error: "Email registered as [other_role]"
8. **If new user:**
   - Creates Firestore document with role
   - Shows success message
   - Navigates to profile setup

## 📊 Firestore Data Structure

When a user signs up with Google, the following document is created:

```javascript
users/{userId}/
  email: "user@gmail.com"
  role: "worker" | "manager"
  isProfileComplete: false
  createdAt: serverTimestamp
  updatedAt: serverTimestamp
```

## 🎨 UI Components Added

## 🌟 What's Special About This Implementation

1. **Role-Aware**: Google Sign-In respects worker/manager boundaries
2. **Auto-Creation**: First-time Google users get Firestore accounts automatically
3. **Consistent UX**: Same button design and flow across all screens
4. **Error Prevention**: Can't use same Google email for both roles
5. **Smart Navigation**: Routes to correct screen based on profile status
6. **Production-Ready**: Proper error handling and loading states
7. **Terms Compliance**: Signup requires terms agreement even for Google

---

## 📝 Optional: Adding Google Logo Asset

To show the actual Google logo instead of the fallback icon:

1. Download Google logo from: https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines
2. Add to project: `assets/images/google_logo.png`
3. Update `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   flutter:
     assets:
       - assets/images/google_logo.png
   ```

The current implementation already has a fallback icon (`Icons.g_mobiledata`), so it works without the asset!
