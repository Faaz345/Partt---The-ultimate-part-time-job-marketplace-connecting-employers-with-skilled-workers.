## 🎨 Design Patterns Used

### Gradient Pattern
```dart
gradient: LinearGradient(
  colors: [
    AppConstants.primaryColor,
    AppConstants.primaryColor.withOpacity(0.8),
    AppConstants.darkBackground,
  ],
  begin: Alignment.topLeft,
  end: Alignment.bottomRight,
)
```

### Card Pattern
```dart
decoration: BoxDecoration(
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(20.r),
  boxShadow: [
    BoxShadow(
      color: AppConstants.primaryColor.withOpacity(0.3),
      blurRadius: 15,
      offset: Offset(0, 8),
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Input Field Pattern
```dart
decoration: InputDecoration(
  filled: true,
  fillColor: AppConstants.backgroundColor,
  border: OutlineInputBorder(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16.r),
    borderSide: BorderSide.none,
  ),
  focusedBorder: OutlineInputBorder(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16.r),
    borderSide: BorderSide(
      color: AppConstants.primaryColor,
      width: 2,
    ),
  ),
)
```

### Button Pattern
```dart
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    backgroundColor: AppConstants.primaryColor,
    padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 18.h),
    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16.r),
    ),
    elevation: 0,
  ),
)
```

## 🔒 Security Implemented

### Firestore Rules Recommended
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Users can only read/write their own data
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Ensure role field cannot be changed after creation
      allow update: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.auth.uid == userId 
                    && request.resource.data.role == resource.data.role;
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 📊 Firestore Data Structure

```javascript
users/{userId}/
  - email: string
  - role: 'worker' | 'manager'
  - isProfileComplete: boolean
  - fullName: string
  - phoneNumber: string
  - age: number
  - location: string
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - updatedAt: timestamp
  
  // Worker-specific fields
  - skills: string[]
  - experience: string
  - availability: string
  
  // Manager-specific fields
  - businessDetails: {
      companyName: string
      industry: string
      teamSize: string
    }
```
