# Partt Flutter App - Complete Implementation Plan

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Partt** is a Flutter + Firebase mobile app that connects workers and managers for part-time jobs. The app features role-based UX with separate experiences for Workers and Managers, from onboarding through job discovery, application management, and secure communications.

## 📱 App Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles with feature-based organization:

│   └── widgets/            # Reusable UI components
└── features/
    ├── auth/               # Authentication & user management
    ├── onboarding/         # App introduction screens
    ├── profile/            # User profile management
    ├── jobs/               # Job posting & discovery

    }
    
    // Jobs are readable by all authenticated users
    match /jobs/{jobId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.managerId == request.auth.uid ||

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

To continue development:

1. **Run the app**: `flutter run` (should show splash → onboarding → login flow)
2. **Next priority**: Complete the profile setup screen with camera integration
3. **Testing**: Set up Firebase project and configure authentication
4. **Development flow**: Feature branch → Testing → Code review → Merge

The foundation is solid, and the app architecture supports rapid feature development. Focus on one feature at a time, testing thoroughly before moving to the next phase.
